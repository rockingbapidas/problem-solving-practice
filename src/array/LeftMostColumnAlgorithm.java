/*
Given a binary matrix mat[][] containing 0’s and 1’s. Each row of the matrix is sorted in the non-decreasing order,
the task is to find the left-most column of the matrix with at least one 1 in it.
Note: If no such column exists return -1.

Examples:

Input:
mat[2][2] = {{0, 0},
             {1, 1}}
Output: 1
Explanation:
The 1st column of the
matrix contains at least a 1.

Input:
mat[2][2] = {{0, 0},
             {0, 0}}
Output: -1
Explanation:
There is no such column which
contains at least one 1.
